################### Heartbeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file is an example configuration file highlighting only some common options.
# The heartbeat.reference.yml file in the same directory contains all the supported options
# with detailed comments. You can use it for reference.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/index.html

############################# Heartbeat ######################################

# Define a directory from which to load monitor definitions. Definitions take the form
# of individual yaml files.
heartbeat.config.monitors:
  # Directory + glob pattern to search for configuration files
  path: ${path.config}/monitors.d/*.yml
  # If enabled, heartbeat will periodically check the config.monitors path for changes
  reload.enabled: false
  # How often to check for changes
  reload.period: 5s

# Configure monitors inline
heartbeat.monitors:
- type: http
  enabled: true
  id: my-monitor
  name: My Monitor
  urls: ${URLS}
  schedule: '@every 10s'
  timeout: 10s
  # Name of corresponding APM service, if Elastic APM is in use for the monitored service.
  #service.name: my-apm-service-name

# ======================= Elasticsearch template setting =======================

setup.kibana:

  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
  #host: "localhost:5601"

  # Kibana Space ID
  # ID of the Kibana Space into which the dashboards should be loaded. By default,
  # the Default Space will be used.

# ================================== Outputs ===================================

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

# ---------------------------- Elasticsearch Output ----------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
#   # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["es01:9200", "es02:9200", "es03:9200"]

#   # Authentication credentials - either API key or username/password.
#   #api_key: "id:api_key"
  username: "elastic"
  password: ${ELASTIC_PASSWORD}


# ------------------------------ Logstash Output -------------------------------
# output.logstash:
#   # The Logstash hosts
#   hosts: ["logstash:5044"]
#   index: "heartbeat"

  # Optional SSL. By default is off.
  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications

  # Certificate for SSL client authentication
  #ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

# ================================= Processors =================================

processors:
  - add_observer_metadata:
      # Optional, but recommended geo settings for the location Heartbeat is running in
      #geo:
        # Token describing this location
        #name: us-east-1a
        # Lat, Lon "
        #location: "37.926868, -78.024902"


# ================================== Logging ===================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors, use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publisher", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]

# ============================= X-Pack Monitoring ==============================
# Heartbeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#monitoring.enabled: false

# Sets the UUID of the Elasticsearch cluster under which monitoring data for this
# Heartbeat instance will appear in the Stack Monitoring UI. If output.elasticsearch
# is enabled, the UUID is derived from the Elasticsearch cluster referenced by output.elasticsearch.
#monitoring.cluster_uuid:

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch outputs are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
#monitoring.elasticsearch:

# ============================== Instrumentation ===============================

# Instrumentation support for the heartbeat.
#instrumentation:
    # Set to true to enable instrumentation of heartbeat.
    #enabled: false

    # Environment in which heartbeat is running on (eg: staging, production, etc.)
    #environment: ""

    # APM Server hosts to report instrumentation results to.
    #hosts:
    #  - http://localhost:8200

    # API Key for the APM Server(s).
    # If api_key is set then secret_token will be ignored.
